# 2048 Puzzle Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game using **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface and **NumPy** for efficient matrix operations. Players can slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them and reach the target tile value of **2048**.

## Overview
The **2048 Puzzle Game** is an engaging single-player game where players combine tiles with identical values by sliding them in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. The objective is to combine tiles to reach the number **2048** on a single tile, but players can continue playing for higher scores.

## Features
- **4x4 Grid**: A simple 4x4 grid where tiles are added and combined.
- **Sliding Tiles**: Move tiles in any of the four directions (up, down, left, right).
- **Score Calculation**: Scores increase as tiles merge.
- **Winning Condition**: Reach 2048 to win.
- **Game Over Condition**: Game ends when no moves are left.
- **Restart Option**: Option to start a new game if the player loses or wishes to try again.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language.
- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface.
- **NumPy**: For efficient matrix handling and tile operations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (included with Python)
- NumPy library

## How to Play

**Objective** : Slide the numbered tiles on the grid to combine them, aiming to create a tile with the number 2048.

**Controls**:
Use Arrow Keys to slide tiles in the desired direction.
Tiles with the same value will merge when they collide in the direction of movement.
Game Over: The game ends when no moves are possible

## Game Mechanics
**Adding New Tiles**: After every move, a new tile (2 or 4) is randomly added to an empty cell.

**Score Calculation**: Every time two tiles merge, their values are added to the score.

**Winning**: If a tile with the value 2048 appears on the board, the player wins, but they can choose to continue for a higher score.
